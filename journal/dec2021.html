            <h1>Keep It Up!</h1>
           
            <p>I don't quite know what this is referring to, honestly. Teaching, studio, art-centric activities, friend/family relationships, dating... this title may as well refer to everything that pertains to my present life.</p>

            <p>Insofar as teaching goes, I have yet to internalize that careful balance of accomodation and distance. "Work/Life" balance manages to say so much yet convey so little when applied to this context. Consider the consequence of neglect in either case! If I neglect the work, I neglect the feedback, the student experience and their aspirations related to the subject matter. I (without being overdramatic about it) am the eye through which future engagement is a risk, through which some will snag and others will coast through without working. The consequence on life is simpler, but perhaps more... dire. This neglect neglects opportunity, relationships, and self improvement, I suppose. It's all encompassing, and really highlights how dumb my "3 class + 30hours/week" idea was.</p>

            <p>Still, even as an eye of a particular kind of needle, I'm not a super conductor. Pedestal aside, I'm a fairly inert material. I may lend a spark, but that kind of thing is off-the-cuff, really. Narrowness or openness, too, doesn't affect the student <em>working</em>.</p>
            
            <p>The studio has been an interesting percolator recently. Some conceptual work; some exactitude of measuring; some cartooning, too; I'm apprehensive of the framework behind it all. Some of the concern is ideologically ("What am I saying?", and other boring questions), while most of it is monetary. What do I sell? To whom? How do I accomplish as much in an ethical way? What does that mean, anyway?</p>

            <p>The exciting bits keep those questions at bay, though. I work to financially afford this kind of thing, no? Keep working, then. Satisfy yourself with the suprise inherent to paper layering, to veering off the reference path and into painted territory. Have your comic pages ready and, while you may know the jist, just... draw intuitively! Define the black/white as you go along. Practice on the page instead of in the brain, dumby. Keep those deadlines in mind.</p>

            <p>And now I'm winding down! So much left to say: open studios give me pause (I'm out of shape in multiple ways); my work/life balance extends to encounters with family/friends (I don't establish calendar dates or boundaries and feel betrayed when others don't do that work for me!); intimacy feels less and less... I don't know! It's like relapsing into a place of yearning, without the bulwark to define and to restrict my incentives. I downloaded Tinder again... for what purpose?</p>

            <p>Keep it up, I suppose! The rut stays put, and I am not a rut! I've got a lot of work to do.</p>
