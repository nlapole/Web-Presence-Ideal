                I'm sorry to admit this, but I always disavowed Illustrator until fairly recently. Perhaps I finally understood the distinctions between hand drawing and "illustrating", and learned to love the unique process inherent to tracing with the pen tool. It's quite the pickle; the smut makes the pickle more tolerable, I suspect!
